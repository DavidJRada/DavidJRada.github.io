<h1>ToDo-ist (A mostly weather app)<h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2> 
View current and forecasted weather information and keep track of single tasks.

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
The site has a field to enter the city you wish to retreive weather information on and radio buttons to decide what unit of temperature you prefer. The search bar will take in any city in the U.S. 

Once a location and temperature unit are chosen, clicking the current button will open a modal with the current weather information; clicking the forecast button will populate a table showing the next 5 forecast predictions 3 hours apart. The users choice of location and units will be stored locally and saved after the page is refreshed.

In the productivity section, the user can add simple tasks and mark them completed after they have done them. The tasks will move to the completed section.

This app uses JavaScript and JQuery, HTML and css. The app is responsive to different browser or mobile size screens.

<h2>Initial Idea</h2>
The initial idea for this project was to make the productivy and to do list portion of the site act as a calendar with reminders. These events would also pull in the forecasted weather information for that time.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
After coming up with the initial idea and setting an ambitious goal, I began writing code with only a simple wire frame and a bullet point list of goals. The lack of sufficient planning and a good understanding of where my skills were, let to a lot of early frustration and restarting my HTML/css on day 3. 

When restarting my design, I planned the portions out much better and planned things that were much more in line with my skill level. For the next project, I will spend more time making wire frames and mockups of how each button will interact witht he rest of the page. I will make sure to include the user stories and all the requirements for the project to make sure that it is thought out before I begin coding. Once I have a sufficient plan in place, I will work on some basic HTML/css frames that will include boxes and buttons labeled appropriately. This should help me accomplish the JS work while not needing to worry about styling as I go.

<h2>Improvements</h2>

I would like to store the to do items in local storage and allow different users to log in to keep track of their tasks. I would like these tasks to be added to a calendar and set up reminders when they are approaching. I would like to store these tasks/reminders in a database to be available when needed.
